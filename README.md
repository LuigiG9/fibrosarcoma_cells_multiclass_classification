# fibrosarcoma_cells_multiclass_classification
Fibrosarcoma is a malignant tumour affecting the fibrous connective tissue. It is characterized by undifferentiated fibroblasts organized to form a stratiform pattern, usually appearing in males between 30 and 40 years. It originates in fibrous bone tissues and mainly spread in long or flat bones, often involving periosteum and overlying muscle. There are different types of diagnosable fibrosarcoma (e.g. melanoma of the spindle cells, synovial sarcoma, etc.), with traditional tests based on immunohistochemistry to exploit the selective identification of antibodies to antigens in biological tissues. Unfortunately, immunohistochemistry has some disadvantages, including among all i) costly equipment and ii) a high operator-dependant outcome. As a consequence, the analysis of the individual cells of the neoplastic tissue is preferable, as it allows us to evaluate in a more precise way cancer behavior or the response to therapy. Usually, these evaluations are made in laboratories by expert operators and require long times and high consumption of resources. The aim of this work is to recognise four different cell types (multi-class classification) according to their morphology.
